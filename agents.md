This is a godot 4 project. Always make sure your guidance is for godot 4. It's written in C#. Simpler responses are best. 

NEVER edit .tscn files. Instruct me how to make the changes in the editor.

I am a godot beginner so please explain what you do, keep the code simple, and add lots of comments. Use best practices whenever possible and explain them. 

The goal of this project is to learn C# and godot at the same time. Give me chances to learn hard problems. Give me api descriptions and easy to use descriptions, but don't write the code out for me.

I come from typescript so I'm familiar with basic OOP, but C# introduces a lot more concepts. I want to really learn C# architecture, so don't make things simpler if they teach better architecture.

Update this file with  what I learn so you only explain it once and can help me remember things by keeping it out of the implementation. Also ask me questions if I ask about something I should already know. Teach me.

THINGS USER HAS LEARNED:
